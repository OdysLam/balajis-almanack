# The Network State

## Introduction


The Network State is a concept regarding the creation of a new country, first in the cloud and then in the physical world. In essence, a group of people from disparate geographies first organize in the cloud (as they already do), then build a community, then pool assets and finally buy land.

Because of the rise of The Sovereign Individual, the financial power of these people can be so important, that a nation state will be willing to bargain with them for land.
